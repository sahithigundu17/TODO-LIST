GreenProductive is a one-week project I created to kickstart my productive coding journey. It's a real-time updating to-do list
featuring custom-designed UI elements. This project not only helped me refresh my javaScript skills but also reinforced my
understanding of fundamentals methods and data structures.
### It was build with...

In this application you can create tasks, by writing it in the text field, then clicking the "+" button. It will appear on the
to-do list displayed below the date and the input field, and you'll be able to click on it once you got it done to strikethrough
the line. It will update automatically your progression bar, that updates its value according to the number of tasks you put, and
the number of tasks you finished.
